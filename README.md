# Software goal and concept:
### User Stories
User 1: Frustrated parents/guardians who would like to have their kids do their chores when asked, not when they feel like it!
User 2: 10 year old who’s been begging their parents for a playstation 4 for weeks but refuses to clean their room.

### Goal
To create an app that will provide parents some comic relief while helping incentivize their kids to do their chores, tasks, or just be a better little human. 

### Concept
Santa-themed entertainment app that would allow a child’s good or bad deeds to be tracked up until Christmas. Each deed, whether good or bad, would be given a number by the parent to reflect the severity of said deed. This data would then get added to the child’s ongoing scorecard tally. In the app, there would be the ability to see a child’s visual progress with the use of a bar chart. Ideally, the app would also give badges/virtual sticker once a child reaches a certain milestone and the child’s wishlist would be connected with amazon (not for the MVP though).
